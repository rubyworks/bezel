<h1>Bezel</h1>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>The idea of Bezel is to overcome the limitations of using different
versions of the same package in the same Ruby process.</p>

<h2>USAGE</h2>

<p>It works like this. Let's say I wrote a library called TomsLib. Now I
want to use TomsLib in my new fancy app, FancyApp. In my FancyApp
namespace I have to create a reference to TomsLib.</p>

<pre><code> module FancyApp
   TomsLib = lib('tomslib', '1.5')
   ...
</code></pre>

<p>Now I have access to TomsLib, but it is localized to my application.
If Jane comes along and wants to use a different version of TomsLib
but also utilizes my FancyApp, she could do so:</p>

<pre><code> module JanesProgram
   TomsLib  = lib('tomslib', '1.0')
   FancyApp = lib('fancyapp')  # use newest available
   ...
</code></pre>

<p>How does this work? When you call lib(), Bezel looks for the package
in the current Gem paths (and in the future, Roll ledger) then it
reads the primary package file (eg. tomslib.rb) from the package and
evals it into an anonymous module.</p>

<p>This has a some important effects on how you write your Ruby programs:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Any reference to core/standard libraries must be referenced via '::'
prefix (eg. ::Enumerable).</p></li>
<li><p>Core extensions are not version isolated. So when possible, avoid them
or depend on highly stable standardized bases such as Ruby Facets
and ActiveSupport.</p></li>
<li><p>Since Bezel is a completely different alternative to Ruby's normal
load system, your program will require Bezel be installed by your
users. No big deal. In other words, list it into your projects dependencies.</p></li>
<li><p>Within Bezel dependent libraries #import must be used to load internal
library scripts instead of #require or #load, in order to keep the code
within the annonymous module.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Despite these necessary practices for its use, Bezel is highly advantageous
to the developers and end-users alike in that it puts an end to the dreaded
<i>Dependency Hell</i>.</p>
